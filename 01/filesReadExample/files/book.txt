s-extra is a drop in replacement for native fs. All methods in fs are attached to fs-extra. All fsmethods return promises if the callback isn't passed. You don't ever need to include the original fsmodule again: you can now do this: or if you prefer to make it clear that you're using fs-extra and not fs,
you may wantto name your fs variable fselike so: you can also keep both,
but it's redundant:
ESM
There is also an fs-extra/esm import, 
that supports both default and named exports. 
However, note that fs methods are not included in fs-extra/esm;
you still need to import fs and/or fs/promisesseperately: Defaultexports are supported: but you probably want to just use regular fs-extra instead of fs-extra/esmfor default
